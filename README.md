ADAPY
=====
My collection of scripts to handle my radio astronomical data and other various related tasks.
Mostly for my own benefit, having a backup hosted elsewhere.

NB 2017/10/23 : Some stuff is potentially broken. Most of this has been unused the past year. 
I would recommend using some kind of CASA-core implementation of reading and analysing radio interferometric data.

Needs:
- Pyfitsa
- Scipy (Numpy)
- Matplotlib
- Astropy

Optional:
- MPFIT (for least-square fitting) (Line Fitting)
Recommended:
- Python 2.7 (I know, I should upgrade it to 3, but since I am not using it atm...)

Only tested on my machine, running Ubuntu Linux and with my data (APEX, SMA, ALMA, PdBI, IRAM-30M).
